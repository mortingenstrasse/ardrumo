> This is a software MIDI interface designed to accept serial data from an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) board and convert it into MIDI drum data in OS X.  The application acts as a bridge between sensors connected to the Arduino board and applications such as [GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband) or [Logic](http://www.apple.com/logicstudio/) without requiring additional MIDI hardware.  All data is transferred directly over the USB connection and no additional power source is needed.
